      <p>This is pilot am confirming. Over.</p>
      <p>Did you complete the mission.</p>
      <p>Negative, a squadron of seagulls got in the way. Over.</p>
      <p>Well shoot them down!</p>
      <p>I can't, I'm a consciousness objector</p>
      <p>You have no freedom here, Pilot. Shoot down those space seagulls or return to base to be court martialed.</p>
      <p>Actually according to the Human Rights resolution 1995/83 stated that "persons performing military service should not be excluded from the right to have conscientious objections to military service". So if anythign you're going to be court martialed. Sir. Over. </p>
